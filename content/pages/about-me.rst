My dearest reader,

Welcome to my blog. I doubt you got to it by accident. With any luck, you got to
it because of a search result. If so, I really hope I managed to answer any
questions you may have had. With any luck on your part and skill on mine, you
not only had your question answered, but had questions you didn't know you had
get answered as well! Not only that, but you stuck around long enough to visit
this page and read about me. Thanks!

My name is, as the site title says, Michael Lustfield. I went to school for
computers and ended up learning about business instead. Sure enough, I thought I
knew what I needed to run a successful business. I may have done alright, but
it's not for me. I need to be in front of a terminal emulator, not in front of a
room full of people. That's why I am where I am now.

I'm a Linux server administrator. I'm passionate about the work I do and strive
to learn more every day. From time to time I will run into weird and peculiar
issues that take a lot of effort to solve. Sometimes I get questions that I have
answered many times before. My blog is my repository for solutions and answers.

My goal is to `Keep IT DRY`_. Please check out that page for a complete
description of what I mean. If you have something that I should add, let me
know. I'm easy to find and always looking for new useful content!
