How needlessly complicated can you make one thing?

From Wikipedia: "An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened
to esolang) is a programming language designed as a test of the
boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of
concept, or as a joke. There is usually no intention of the language
being adopted for mainstream programming, although some esoteric
features such as visuospatial syntax have inspired practical
applications in the arts. Such languages are often popular among hackers
and hobbyists. This use of esoteric is meant to distinguish these
languages from more popular programming languages."

It basically is just saying that we sometimes do stupid crap, "just
'cause." This is one of those times. If you ever read The Hitchhikers
Guide to the Galaxy, you'll get this.

The Bash variant is quite large and a link is listed below.

The BrainFuck variant (80 char width):

What am I trying to do with all of this? It should be pretty obvious,
I'm producing the question to the answer of everything.

Normally I'd just say to go try this yourself but apparently people
scare much more easily than I do and they don't know haw to securely
test things so... I just pasted the result.

Now, why would we do something like this? I could go on a depressing
rant about how I have very little to do that's more fun. I'll instead
just say, "Why the hell wouldn't I want to do something so fun!?"

Side note- I get asked a lot if I generated it somehow. I did not. That
would have made it much less fun.
