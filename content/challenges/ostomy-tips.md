My experience with colorectal cancer officially began in 2017. After 8 rounds
of chemo and 27 rounds of radiation, I came out on the other side of surgery
with a permanent colostomy. Learning to live with an ostomy was a bit of a
challenge, so I hope someone else can find these tips helpful.

The Initial Shock
-----------------

For some people, an ostomy is a welcome change from issues such as inflammatory
bowel disease. For others, it comes from a traumatic life event or as part of
a fight with cancer. For anyone receiving an ostomy, there will be an initial
shock.

Going into my surgery, I knew that waking up with the ostomy on my right side would
mean that it was temporary and on the left side would mean it's permanent. My
initial shock came when I awoke and any hope of this being temporary vanished.

A colon resection is a major surgery, and with any major surgery, there's always
recovery and often a lot of pain. This type of surgery, particularly Lower Anterior
Resection (LAR), comes with a high probability of damaging some nerve tissue around
the bladder; it can be very unpleasant and cause re-cathing, but these troubles
should be short-lived. Open and honest communication with a healthcare team is
critical and can alleviate a lot of suffering; most problems that will be
encountered are not uncommon and this communication ensures that those common
solutions (medication, movement, etc.) can be provided.

After surgery, the stoma will be inflamed and it will take time for the swelling to
subside. Cutting each barrier to size is tedious at first, but with some practice,
it becomes quick and easy. More importantly, after the body heals from surgery,
the stoma size will become constant and pre-cut barriers can be ordered. This
eliminates the need to cut each barrier and eliminates potential sharp edges.

Approximately three to nine months after surgery, life should be able to resume
(relatively) as normal. There will still be adjustments and lifestyle changes,
but these become trivial. The body can take over a year to fully recover; however,
the major issues are up front and everything gets exponentially easier as various
body parts finish healing.

The important thing to remember is that "this too, shall pass."

The Best Fit
------------

There are a handful of suppliers and they're all absolutely terrible companies to
deal with. It's common for a Wound Ostomy Continence (WOC) nurse to have a working
relationship with a supplier, but that doesn't mean the supplier cares anything
about customer service. As a patient, it is important to research and shop around
to find the best option. Suppliers, such as Byram, that provide a website to
re-order previously purchased products, may still be terrible and provide a
terrible website, but at least re-ordering won't involve much effort.

Some WOC nurses will try to help by placing orders, but it's common for these
orders to be inaccurate or incomplete. It's often best to ask the nurse what they
recommend and then place an order or request a sample.

Fortunately, unlike suppliers, manufacturers tend to have a strong vested interest
in making sure patients are satisfied; they have sales staff available to help
determine the best "appliance" to fit a particular person. These staff members are
typically very friendly and eager to help. They should be able to answer questions
about products available, provide samples, answer concerns about a  product/sample
received, offer alternatives, offer general advice, etc.

Although no individual is identical to another, the problems encountered are rarely
rare; even if a "perfect" solution can't be provided, what's available should be
able to adequately handle most problems. Seeking samples from various manufacturers
is an excellent way to find just the right fit.

Some basic research should include looking at a catalog provided by a supplier or
two. [Byram provides](https://www.byramhealthcare.com/our-services/our-catalogs)
a massive, disorganized, but helpful catalog which includes
some some nice tips for measuring, management, diet, etc. After finding some
interesting products, do a search to find the company's website. On the site, look
for an option to request a sample--sometimes in the product list--or look for a
"contact us" page. If some of the products seem confusing, then go straight to
that "contact us" page and (ideally) call the manufacturer and ask for help
deciding what product is best.

Coloplast and Hollister have been more than happy to provide a few samples and
even ask if it's okay to notify someone of new products that may potentially be
relevant and helpful so that samples of the product can be provided.

Once the right fit is found, the ostomy experience changes from a daunting chore
to little more than brushing teeth and flossing.

Simple but Effective Tools
--------------------------

Hollister provided one dark disposal bag for each throw-away pouch, but Coloplast
provided a larger/heavier bag for multiple pouches. As disgusting as that may
sound, the implication provided some simple enlightenment.

Rather than relying on the bags they provide, the larger bags are now used when
traveling. One of the larger bags is put underneath the bag in the restroom
garbage can and disposed of at the end of the trip. If using room service, it may
be a good idea to bring along a few extra.

Depending on the company/product chosen, the disposal bags may be adequate. With
Coloplast Sensura, it will be the larger bags and smaller individual-use bags can
be substituted with [bos bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y2S7YTD), or
similar.

Rather than tossing each bag into an open bin that others might frequently walk
by, a `litter genie`_ is an excellent way to keep these hidden away. The lid
carrying the product name can be removed without impacting it's ability to retain
odor. It even provides a discrete place for women to dispose of feminine hygiene
products. It's wise to shop around for [cheaper replacement bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0784BRYYJ);
they're often at least 50% cheaper.

The Belt
--------

Any belt found in a supplier or manufacturer catalog is likely going to include
only medical belts used to treat certain issues, such as a herniation. Another type
of belt is designed to help conceal the ostomy bag. StealthBelt is a well-known
example of this latter type.

These belts are designed to be comfortable, keep the bag discreet, and eliminate
odors/sounds. Unfortunately, they also tend to retain a bit of heat and can cause
a barrier to fail (blow-out).

Instead of opting for the belt, a t-shirt underneath a loose-fitting shirt can
offer nearly the same benefits, without the risk of excess heat. Some barriers
are nicer to live with than others, and other barriers handle excess heat/sweat
better than others. Remember the importance of shopping around; there's no harm
in finding two products that work well in different situations, such as with or
without a belt.

Regardless of whether a belt is used--but especially so--it's extremely important
to watch out for signs of a blow-out. A common symptom will be itching around the
peristomal skin or an unusual sensation of "pancaking."

It's impossible to say if a belt is appropriate for some, just the same way it's
impossible to say if an appliance will be right. It's a bit of a trial-and-error
situation. Fortunately, this situation is all within the control of one person.

Don't Panic
-----------

Many troubles with an ostomy are well-documented and easily-researched. A few,
however, have some elusive answers.

First of all, large white bumps on a stoma are most often normal and caused by
irritation. When they first show up, a surgeon may want to biopsy them, but
it's most likely they're just from irritation. They may or may not ever go away.

A hernia or prolapse will be terrifying the first time they're encountered, but
neither should carry concern about visiting an emergency room. Instead, continue
practicing healthy care and contact a WOC nurse to decide what steps to take next.

It should be noted that improving muscle tone and a healthy diet greatly reduce
the chance of a hernia/prolapse.

Travel
------

Traveling with an ostomy is not terribly difficult, although it does require some
special consideration and planning.

Filters tend to work, but only for short periods of time. If a good diet is
maintained, then it should be possible to make use of stickers that cover the
filter, which can be temporarily/permanently removed. These stickers help ensure
no odor gets out, and help keep the filter from getting plugged from the outside.

As mentioned above, bringing the right quantity and size of disposal bags can be
extremely helpful. A large, heavy-duty, dark-colored bag is great to place
beneath a trash can liner, and smaller bags are ideal for each disposed pouch.

Most hotels hang a hair dryer up in a bag, but the hair dryer can be placed
anywhere convenient and ostomy supplies placed into the bag. This provides a nice
discrete way to keep all necessary items handy while remaining inconspicuous. In
this scenario, even if someone happens across these items, it's not likely the same
person will do so a second time.

If it's possible to tour a destination with a backpack, then it's wise to bring two
sets of ostomy supplies. One set can remain in the room, and another set can be
carried along for any urgent needs.

Conclusion
----------

Living with an ostomy is an adjustment. It takes time to recover and to get used
to a new way of living. A new standard for life will eventually emerge and the
problems that once terrified will become tiny blips in history.
