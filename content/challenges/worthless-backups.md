I thought my backups were pretty good, but I found out otherwise. I had the
following two lines running nightly for my backups.

tl;dr - Always verify that your backups are working before you need them
{{< /notice >}}


**Make MySQL backup**
```
mysqldump -u root -p "$(/.sql.pwd)" --all-databases | gzip > /var/mysqldump/mysql-$(date +%F).gz
```

**Delete old copies**
```
find /var/mysqldump/ -mtime +90 -exec rm {} \;
```

Anybody know what's wrong with that?

For 99% of Linux commands, this would be perfectly good syntax.
Unfortunately, this is one of those 1% times where things aren't the way
you expect them.

I was using ``-u root -p "$(</root/.sql.pwd)"``

What I needed to be using was ``-uroot -p"$(</root/.sql.pwd)"``

When working with MySQL in this syntax, you don't want a space when
passing in an argument.

I have a massive database issue and wasn't able to recover from it. I
tried to restore from the database backups. Problem is that I've been
creating backups of an error message. Worse yet, is I had no way of
knowing without actually going in and trying to restore from a backup.

Bottom line: TEST YOUR BACKUPS
