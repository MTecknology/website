    title: About Me
    items:
      - content: |
          I am an IT architect with a focus on Linux, automation, and security.

          This career path truly started back in late high school when the IT
          coordinator handed me an Ubuntu CD, which started me down a long and
          interesting path of ups and downs, starting with ndiswrapper. While
          attending college, I found myself digging into both web debuggers,
          strace, and other diagnostic utilities in order to troubleshoot any
          problem, no matter how deep it went.

          My first introduction into enterprise environments was a wild first
          week; I was even pulled out of orientation in order to prevent a mail
          service from running out of capacity, which would have happened that
          evening. If not for some extremely well-written documentation and
          other blog posts, that situation could have been catostrophically
          worse. This highlighted the importance of quality documentation and
          the necessity of taking the time to review it before taking action.

          After settling into the role and finding the credentials that were left
          behind, I began to understand what it meant to be the sole linux admin,
          responsible for over 500 servers distributed across the nation. I was
          also responsible for supporting the users that connected to these servers,
          any corporate Linux server, and the applications running on top of them.
          supporting the applications hosted on each. This experience encouraged
          me to adopt configuration management (automation) early on in my career.


          Due to the absence of a suitable test environment at work, I repurposed
          a desktop at home to create a comprehensive network that adhered to best
          practices I could discover. This allowed me to break down work-related
          problems, delve into the underlying technology, and pursue thorough
          investigations to identify root causes and implement lasting solutions
          for recurring issues.

          Outside of work, I contribute to open source projects, primarily focusing
          on bug fixes and enhancements aimed at improving quality of life.
