    title: About Me
    items:
      - content: |
          I am an IT architect with a focus on Linux, automation, and security.

          This career path truly started back in (US) 11th-grade when the IT
          coordinator handed me an Ubuntu CD, which started me down a long and
          interesting path of ups and downs, starting with ndiswrapper. While
          attending college, I found myself digging into both web debuggers,
          strace, and other diagnostic utilities in order to troubleshoot any
          problem, no matter how deep it went.

          My first introduction into enterprise environments was a wild first
          week; I was even pulled out of orientation in order to prevent a mail
          service from running out of capacity, which would have happened that
          evening. If not for some extremely well-written documentation and
          other blog posts, that situation could have been catostrophically
          worse.

          After settling into the role and finding the credentials that were left
          behind--for me, I began learning what it meant to be the only Linux guy
          in charge of 500+ Linux/UNIX servers spread across the entire country,
          in addition to the applications running on each. This experience prompted
          me to be an adopter of configuration management (automation) **very**
          early in my career; this experience also taught me how critically-important
          quality documentation can be ... and to take time to read it.

          This automation was not able to be easily tested at work due to lack
          of any equivalent test environment, which prompted me to repurpose a
          desktop at home and begin the pursuit of a full-fledged network that
          included every best practice that I could research. This gave me an
          amazing opportunity to break down work problems, learn about the
          underlying technology, and investigate long enough to determine a root
          cause and provide a permanent solution to recurring issues.

          When not focused on work activities, I am often spending time contributing
          to [open source projects](/#opensource), with a focus on bug fixes and
          quality-of-life improvements.
