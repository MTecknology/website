Yup... I almost entirely agree.

The Pros:
- Good screen
- Lotsa horse power
- Nice touchpad (unless you need to remove the "calibration" screw...)
- Very sturdy design

The Cons:
- Even at 60hz, not watching videos, and nvidia shut off, battery life is garbage (sad considering how large the battery is)
- Even with low load (IRC, vim, ssh), it produces more heat than is comfortable for a lap
- Speaker placement / quality
- Lack of numpad
- Repair (it's dang near as bad as working inside apple devices)
- Repair #2 (replacing/fixing the keyboard/touchpad basically takes removing nearly all of the internals)
- Linux support (openrazer gets kinda-sorta works a little bit for keyboard/logo lighting, but support pretty much ends there)
- Even with the latest kernel, I still can't make use of an external laptop; Sleep/hibernate still don't work correctly
- It's exceptionally expensive
- Manufacturer support is garbage (took almost half a year just to get recovery media and longer to get the nvidia card replaced)
- HDMI doesn't seem to support 4k/240hz monitors.

If this were free, I'd give it a 3.5/5.
