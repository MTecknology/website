:status: draft

When you travel for work, there can be a lot of frustrations involved. Over the
past few years, I've learned a few lessons that help improve traveling for work,
particularly by air, a much more enjoyable process.

Disclaimer: This comes from a person that travels domestically--within the US.
As I travel abroad, what I learn will be recorded here.

#consultantlyfe
---------------

Most consultants are basically signing up to be well paid and highly intelligent
cattle. We're expected to wrap up our home lives on a dime and go to some place
for the next period of time away from home. To really capitalize on the earning
potential, many single consultants choose to fully relocate to wherever the work
may be.

In my first year as a consultant, I spent an average of four days at my house
per month. After a year of that, I got to spend exactly zero days at home,
travel on the 4th of July, and got to set up shop for the entire month in a
roachy motel. After that month, I finally got to transition to 50% travel, which
would be great if it didn't mean my M-F is still shot because I need to work
local hours two timezones West of me.

Something will eventually need to give- be it your love for work, love of travel,
or the #consultantlyfe. It gets old. As I notice more people frequenting bits
of my flight path, I ask them what they do when it gets old. When asked what
they do when it gets old, they'r response is usually the same, "it gets old."

The travel is often long and rarely paid, hours are wasted to accomodate any
potential delays, hours are wasted because of delays, etc. Regardless of the
tedious monotony, it's almost guaranteed that we have a more enjoyable time
flying than the average passenger. We've managed to figure out how to handle
many of the annoyances of travel and have learned to tune out others.

TSA
---

Let's get this one out of the way up front. The TSA is made up of people who
happen to be humans. Not only are they humans, but they are employed humans
who happen to have a particular job that they're employed to do.

I've had exactly one bad interaction with the TSA, and that one was my fault
because I didn't follow their well advertised rules. I thought I'd get by with
a full tube of toothpaste in the original unopened box and--unlike most other
times I've pulled this stunt--they called me on it.

Has that been my only interaction with them? Absolutely not! One time my bag
was checked and he couldn't find what he was looking for, so he showed me the
screen. What I saw looked like a pair of explosive devices. I pointed to the
exact place in my bag where they were, keeping my hands away from his current
work area, explained what he was looking at, and I was sent along my merry way.

How about another time where you could see clear as day on the scanner that I
was packing a safety razor? For the unfamiliar, a safety razor is a shaving
device that will hold a double edge razor blade. You may not be surprised to
know that these razor blades are not permitted in carry-on luggage. They wanted
to check it to see if it had a blade in it. When I asked what they were looking
for, they told me, and I asked if I could just dig it out for them because I
didn't want them finding some things that were definitely against the rules.

The bottom line is that treating the TSA with respect has worked quite well for
me and every time I've seen issues with TSA, it was because someone wasn't
paying attention, didn't think the rules applied to them, or went directly to
upset that TSA would talk to them at all.

Additionally, even if you have pre-check, yes, you may be randomly selected to
go through the other scanner or, at your option, a pat down. Yes, some of the
people employed by the TSA take things too far, but in most cases you're dealing
with someone wanting to get done with their work day. Work with them, and they
will tend to work with you.

Packing
-------

If you can avoid it, don't travel with checked baggage. It inhibits your ability
to grab an alternate segment should your plane show up early and it means you
have to wait for all luggage to be unloaded after you land.

Ever wonder why luggage gets lost or damaged? The simple answer is that your
luggage is handled by people that don't care in any capacity what happens to any
of it. While I wrote this, I watched a bag fall off of a cart. Unlike what I
typically see, this guy tried to rearrange things so it didn't happen again.
I've previously seen the same bag fall off of a cart four times before the driver
finally pulled back the curtain. Unfortunately, due to poor stacking and erratic
driving, other another bag fell off which he just drove away from, possibly
unaware. Thankfully, someone else drove past the bag and cared enough to do
something about it.

When I travel for two weeks at a time, I manage to do it with a carry-on and a
laptop bag with three laptops in it. I've used the exact same packing list to be
gone for a full month.

As a starting point for people that don't travel much, here's my typical packing
list.

*Carry-on Luggage*

*Toiletries Bag*

* Deodorant (x 2)
* Toothpaste
* Thermometer
* Earplugs
* Disposable razors
* Safety razor
* Q-tips
* Beard trimmer
* Power cords
* Allergy pills

Get a Taxi Driver
-----------------

Simply arranging transportation to and from the airport can seem like a daunting
task. The initial approach tends to be soliciting family and friends when it's
convenient for the person and finding the cheapest taxi in any other scenario.

If you have more money than you know what to do with, the obvious answer is to
hire a car service. For most people, hiring a dedicated car service is a bit
silly. Fortunately, there's a better option--find a taxi driver and "hire" them.

To "hire" a driver, you'll need to find a small taxi service with a small number
of employees. This gives you the chance to build a one-on-one relationship.
Ideally you'll make this relationship with your driver, but there's no harm in
settling for a business relationship.

The key here is that you're not establishing any level of official business
relationship. This means no paperwork, no official agreement, and most importantly,
it means you'll be dealing with people that have a personal interest in your
satisfaction.

Making this happen is surprisingly easy, you simply need to tip well, be flexible,
and schedule. I look for a taxi service with less than five employees who do the
work because they have some passion for something about what they do.--My current
driver doesn't care about the taxi business, but he loves owning his own business
and making sure customers are eager to return.--I ask them if I can schedule a
pickup via text message and get a business card while informing them that I'm
looking for reliable and safe service. I attempt to give a minumum of a two days
heads up when scheduling a pick-up, but not much longer to prevent the schedule
from being misplaced. Most importantly, I tip well. I tip a consistent 30% and
most cab drivers stop running the meter for me. I know the trip, I know their
meter charge, and I give a static payment extra for that route.

This does *not* mean there are never scheduling conflicts. Most recently, my
driver expressed a significant amount of relief because I was willing to change
a pick-up time to 15 minutes earlier. On the ride, I learned that he could have
managed picking me up at the originally requested time, but he was hoping to
ensure he had ample time make it to his next appointment and have enough time
in case anything were to happen, such as a flat tire. This is the type of thing
I look for. Being flexible gives them incentive to find some solution to make
your request work, even if it means inconveniencing the both of you.

Bottom line: Find a reliable taxi service, tip well, every time, emphasize
reliability and scheduling, and build a personal relationship with them.

Getting Through Security
------------------------

As much as I'm able to defend most TSA agents as respectable human being just
looking to finish their day, they are people and some of them are scum bags.
These encounters suck and are typically what headlines are made of. Sorry. :(

For every other encounter, the easiest way to avoid problems is to simply know
what you're doing. For now, I'll assume that you do not have TSA-precheck. If
you need this list, or find something new or interesting in it, then you do not
need TSA-precheck.

When you walk in, if you have a bag that's over-sized, you'll need to walk up to
the counter and have it checked. Know the size of your luggage and the size
restrictions. If at all possible, try to know the space of the overhead bins to
help anticipate gate checking a bag. If you are bringing a weapon, it *MUST* be
declared, in a locked case, and in checked baggage without any ammo.

If you're only looking to get a printed copy of your ticket here, then you can
usually find a dedicated kiosk line. Larger airports have defaulted to kiosk
lines with agents nearby in case you declare checked baggage at the kiosk.

Personally, I like to make sure my phone is fully charged and rely on web copies
of my ticket. Oddly, I've found them to be much more reliable than printed copies
simply because of mistakes with ink. This is a great spot to mention that you
must be using the ticket for the first leg of your trip to get through security.

Once you pass the ticket agent, if you stop there at all, your next stop is that
highly-anticipated TSyay! In most airports, you'll get to enjoy a long line.
Feel free to be frustrated with this line if it's an airport like <cough>, but
take the opportunity put *EVERYTHING* that you have in your pockets into your
luggage, except for your ID and ticket. For me, that's my phone; I put my phone
immediately into my laptop bag as I walk away from the first guy. Once you're
waved forward by the TSA agent, walk up. If you have a paper ticket, you'll hand
them the ticket and your ID; if you're using your phone, you'll hand them your ID
and then you'll scan your own ticket.

When it comes to scanning the ticket on your phone, turn the screen brightness
nice and high and turn off any auto-rotate feature. These two little steps are
sure to eliminate most (or all) of your phone scanning woes.

Next up, the scanners. For our non-precheck folks, you'll want to put your shoes
and toiletries in one bin. Put each laptop you're carrying into its own bin;
your laptop bag will also go into its own bin. The charger and everything else
can stay in there, but the laptops must be removed. Note, you should have no
metal on you because you put all that away while you were in line. All you have
to do now is place your items on the belt, wait to be waved forward, step into
the dreadful scanner, hands over your head, and step out once the scanner did
its semi-circle pass.

If you're not a horrible criminal, your luggage will come through, you'll put
it all back together, and you'll be on your way. I've always held my ID and
license in my hands going through these scanners and never had anyone say
anything about it.

If you do happen to be a horrible criminal, your bag will be pulled aside for
a bag check. This typically means something funny popped up on the scanner. In
some cases, you might be carrying a harmless item that looks like a pair of
explosive devices. There are a few simple rules of engagement. Remember that
these are people with very boring and repetitive jobs and this is a mundane
break from the routine. By remaining relaxed and responsive, you'll keep the
situation calm and controlled. Once your luggage has touched the belt, it is no
longer in your possession. Until it passes through the scanner or is released
to you. This means you can not touch it. You may offer to show them exactly
where the item is, and they may refuse. Don't ask why--this is called
challenging/escalation.

In most cases, just remaining calm and responsive is all that's needed to avoid
issues with TSA agents.

For the record, every TSA agent has allowed me to see the scanner and point out
the exact location of what they're looking for. In only one situation was I
permitted to grab the item myself.

TSA Pre-check
-------------

Have you noticed those TSA Pre-check lines that provide shortened lines and
relaxed security screening? If you're a frequent traveler that's familiar with
the entire security screening process, then you may be tempted to look into
getting this expidited screening. If you're not a frequent traveler--for the
sake of havin a number, let's say at least ten flights per years--I strongly
recommend skipping the service.

For those of us that obtain pre-check, we have different rules to follow. For
starters, unless you have metal in your shoes, they stay on your feet. If they
do have enough metal to set off a metal detector, you get to still take them off
of your feet to be scanned. If an agent informs you that's not needed, just say,
"they have metal." Your laptops stay in your bag.

If you have a safety razor in your bag, you'll need to either remove it and put
it in a bowl or orientate it in your luggage so that it looks like something else
on the scanner.

Gate Checking Bags
------------------

Gate checking a bag is *NOT* for being too lazy to check it at the counter. If
you do this you are holding up our flights and we all hate you for it. If,
however, your bag is within size limits but the overhead bins are full or too
small, you will get to experience gate checking. A tag will be put on your
luggage and you'll be given the ticket stub. You'll leave your luggage at the
end of the jet bridge (walkway from gate to plane). When you depart the plane,
after landing, you will typically stand right outside of the plane lined up
along the edge as passengers pass you. The gate checked luggage will be brought
back up for you to claim and keep going.

In some situations, your gate checked luggage will be "checked to your final
destination." In most cases, all this means is that your luggage won't be picked
up as you depart the plane, but rather at the baggage claim area. Instead of a
small tag and tiny stub, you're luggage will receive the larger sticky tags and
you'll be given the claim ticket.

Be careful, though. If you check your luggage to the final destination, it means
you are locked into your flight path.

Getting Alternate Flights
-------------------------

If you're a frequent traveler, you likely build in a bit of "acts of god" time.
At one particular airport, I schedule a minimum two hour layover just to be able
to accomodate unexpected problems. Sometimes, this means I'll get to the airport
early enough that I can catch an alternate flight to my destination.

In order to pull this off, you need to have no checked luggage, the alternate
flight has to have not begun boarding, the gate agent needs to approve it, and
you need to stay out of their face. There ar sometimes exceptions to earlier
flights. In the past, I've been in a position where a rep has called into question
my physical ability to literally sprint approximately twenty gates to reach an
already fully boarded plane where the pilot or gate agent could have easily said
they will not be waiting for me. No reason was needed to say no, but they chose to
say yes. I sprinted half of Terminal B in DEN w/ and by the time I got there,
the pilot was starting to walk into the hallway and asked me if I'm the guy.

It can be frustrating when the gate agent could obviously let you on but is just
choosing to be both lazy and stubborn, but the only thing that means is that you
don't get to go on the earlier flight.

If you're on the flip side of this and arrive late but haven't missed your flight,
feel free to explain to the gate agent that you're pushing the time for your next
flight and ask them to call the gate to let them know you're heading directly
there. The gate agent doesn't have to call and your connection doesn't have to
wait, but we're still talking about real people doing a job, and in most cases,
they'll be willing to provide that simple service. Even if that gate agent
declines helping you out, look for a nearby counter without a line.

If you've completely missed your flight, you still need to not panic. Ask a gate
agent where the nearest customer service counter is, and enjoy a nice long wait
in line.

Sometimes, when the alternate flight is boarding or soon to be boarding and the
line is long enough there's no way I'll make it, I've been known to take a risk
and head to the gate. The one time I dared try this, I ended up being put on the
flight.

In addition to not panicking, even if you're in such a tight situation, DO NOT
crowd the agents! Standing at the far edge of the counter does not count, and
neither does standing nearby intently watching their every move.

From the words of the ticket agent, "why the **** are you crowding the ****
counter? I'm sorry, but there is nothing we agents hate more than customers that
crowd the **** counter. Just go away, sit down, and if we can get you on this
flight we'll make it happen."

So, we need to not be near the counter. Go up to them, explain the situation, and
if you won't be provided an instant yes or no, then ask if they'd like you to just
sit down and wait. Then go ahead and do exactly that.

Boarding Time
-------------

In most cases, you'll be boarding by group number. The first passengers that get
to board are active military, families with kids under X years of age, and people
with disabilities. Next up is the numbered groups. You board by your group number.

This is where it gets tricky, see, lines do not have to form straight out into
the hallway where people are trying to get from one gate to the next. Have you
ever noticed moving walkways in between gates? You might be surprised to know
that people forming lines directly away from the gates are part of the reason
these moving walkways exist. If we could just simply learn to wrap our lines
around parallel to direction everyone is moving, travel starts to look much less
insane. Better yet is when people that didn't get up there to start a short line
just stay seated and wait for their group number to be called before calmly
forming a line.

As you're boarding, remember that everyone behind you is counting on you to get
get your luggage stowed and to get into your seat so that they can do the same.

When you do find your seat, stow your luggage right away. Carry-on bags go in
wheel first and lengthwise. Your other "personal item" goes completely underneath
the seat in front of you until you're in the air. Please, don't make me make you
do it. It's awkward for me when I put your seat up for you or put your stuff
where it belongs for my own personal safety. As someone who's bothered
researching the why, I will absolutely do it if you do not.

In The Sky
----------

Once you get into your seat and buckled up and finish attentively listening to
the flight attendent, it's take off time!

What are the basic rules of not hating everyone around you?!

* The person in the middle gets the arm rests (both)
* The person in the window seat gets only the window arm rest
* Better yet, don't use them, unless you're in first class
* Please, thank-you, and a smile are always appropriate
* Earplugs and headphones are a polite "leave me alone"
* Not in the isle seat and need the restroom? I like to start with, "I'm sorry..."

Traveler Pet Peeves
-------------------

For fun, I started asking some of the frequent travelers I met what some of
their biggest pet peeves are. This part gets fun because I have not once heard
"screaming infants" or "TSA" as a response.

Their responses:

* "To be honest, it's the guy next to me that tries to chat me up when I'm just
  trying to relax." (I was that guy)
* Travelers that hold me up because they're completely clueless.
* Parents that let their kids kick strangers because they're feeling cranky.

Leaving the Plane
-----------------

Similar to boarding time, people are counting on you to get moving and off the
plane so they can do the same. If you're not able to handle this, I assure you,
passengers that choose to wait for others to pass are absolutely appreciated,
at least by other passengers.

You get off the plane in the order of seats. One row fully exits their row
before the next row starts. You're not special, you know the rule, it's basic
common sense... no excuses. Be Patient.

On the flip side of this coin. If you're not ready to get off the plane, this is
*not* the time to stand in the ilse putting your crap together. I, like many
others, will push you out of the way. You got a problem with it? Learn how to
travel.

Please, let this emphasize how quickly you will upset people in this situation.
Patience for the person in front of you is expected, but limited to about 5-10
seconds. It's easier to just pay attention to the flight attendants when they
tell you to pack it up.

That person that was stuck putting their luggage in farther back bins? It is
quiet appropriate to let these people past you, if at all possible. It's also
not a bad idea to ask them if you can reach it for them. It's not just being
extra friendly, it's a sucky situation for them to be in and inconvenient for
everyone.

Transportation
--------------

Transportation is another area where brand-loyalty is worthwhile. I've been able
to be upgraded from an economy car up to a Mercedez SLK300. That was a nice
surprise considering I'd mentioned it only as a joke and already said I'm okay
with the current assignment. He told me a stall number that I could check out
and take it if I like it. I liked it! Yes, I also went back and thanked him.

If you're getting a rental, then it's likely you're in walking distance to the
vehicles or else the rental agency is likely to run a shuttle. I've found that,
in most cases, if you're in an area that doesn't have Uber, cab fares tend to
remain somewhat reasonable, but that's also from a small sample size. In my
experience, reasonable is usually about 4x what Uber will charge outside of
surge pricing.

Sometimes, your cheapest route is not the obvious route. There have been times
where I've wanted to fly through DEN to SJC but had to take a lesser flight to
SFO and then take an uber all the way back to SJC I didn't go into SJC, but my
desination was right there. The cabbie provided an estimated $140 to get me
there. Since uber estimated the trip to be nearly $100 less, I opted for Uber.

Hotels
------

Again, brand-loyalty matters. Hilton, Marriott, and Sheraton are your three big
options. At the time of this writing, I'm over half way to having lifetime status
with my prefered hotel.

Perhaps the most important thing to do when you get to your hotel is to be
friendly and respectful. I've found that most people working here enjoy the work
and are eager to make everyone happy. If you return the favor by being happy
and friendly, it's amazing what lengths they'll go to when issues happen.

Restaraunts & Bars
------------------

When I'll be in an area for an extended period of time, I find it incredibly
beneficial to find the best restaurant in the area with reasonable prices as
well as a fully stocked bar that I can sit at.

If you find a place like this, pay attention to the bar tenders. The best bar
tender is likely to know about all of the cool places in an area. When you find
this person, make them like you! Be friendly, engage in real conversation,
actually be a nice and likeable person! On top of that, you should consistenty
tip very well. If you order food at the bar, NEVER ask or extra services. A bar
tender is *NOT* a waiter and this is one of the second quickest ways to make
them hate you. Next up, be respectful of their time. They're busy and will chat
when they are free and if they feel like it.

Many of you may read this and think it's a series of horribly obvious statements,
but I assure you, it's not that obvious to many people.

Here's where it gets fun. That knowledgeable bar tender probably knows almost
everything about anything... including things of questionable legality. If you
want to ask them about this subject matter, then it's a great thing they're now
a buddy of yours that you also tip very well. When they're not busy, feel free
to quietly ask them about it. Be subtle, quiet, and accept no.

Of course, you don't need to use the relationship for this. Ask them if they
happen to know of any really awesome whiskey bars. The last time I asked my bar
tender this question, we wound at a beach with a bar, followed by a whiskey bar
in the back room. I walked out of there with a new drink in my top five.

Summary
-------

This got much longer than I anticipated! Unfortunately, I don't think I can come
up with a nice little summary. Really, if you travel, you should either know
everyhing I listed above by heart or you should be emailing me your disagreement.

A few key points, though:

* Know what's going on around you
* If you're holding people up, get out of the way
* Establish relationships with the people you meet
* Be respectful, friendly, and courteous
