Recent events have convinced me that it was time to retire my home
infrastructure/network. Services running within needed to be migrated to new

to see how all of this came together to aid the final decomission.

Many personal relationships were established throughout the years. Some were

relationships, the projects still serving value would have been turned off,
leaving users with no alternatives.

Having established and maintained healthy relationships with other users has
made my experience in pone source much more fun and productive.

Checklist
